# OCR Image Reader

This extension adds a toolbar button to your browser to perform OCR. When this action button is pressed, it allows the user to select a region in the currently active window. The extension captures the area and tries to recognize text inside this region using the internal powerful OCR engine (Tesseract engine). This extension uses the "tesseract.js" library that supports more than 100 languages, automatic text orientation, and script detection.
